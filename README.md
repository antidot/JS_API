JS_API : BETA

Javascript API for AFS

This API works to call ACP in cross-domain.

For this case the API works only in ASYNCHRONUS mode.

To use this API read the "API Documentation.doc"

You can look the index.html for example of integration and initialisation of ACP object.

Warning : If you call an ANTIDOT URL, you can have some CORS error. In this case thanks to contact the ANTIDOT Support.
